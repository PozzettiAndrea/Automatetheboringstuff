character classes:
\d = digits
\D = any non numeric digit
\w = any letter, numeric digit or the underscore character 
(any "word" characters, no punctuation mark or spaces)
\W = any non word character, see above
\s = any space, tab or newline character
\S = any non \s character
\n = newline
you can create your own character classes by:
vowelclass = re.compile(r'[aeiou]')

capital letters a to f = re.compile(r'[A-F]')

^ means the opposite of whatever you have in your list
